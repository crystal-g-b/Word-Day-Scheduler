# Work-Day-Scheduler

In this assignment, we were challenged to create a day planner. We were given the html and css file and then needed to create our JS file from scratch.

## For this assignment, the acceptance criteria is as follows:

* GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
* WHEN I open the planner
* THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* WHEN I scroll down
* THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
* WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
* THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
* WHEN I click into a timeblock
* THEN I can enter an event
* WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
* THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
* WHEN I refresh the page
* THEN the saved events persist

Throughout this assignment I utilized Jquery, Bootstrap to help style and add function to the day planner. I first added timeblocks to the html file and used bootstrap elements in order to stylize the day planner. I also made slight adjustment to the css based on my own color preferences.

After this, I proceeded to build my JS file and use pseudo code to help me decide on each step that needed to be taken to carryout my ultimate goal.

The finished product culminated in the below image:
